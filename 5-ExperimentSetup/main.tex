% \todo{Write a chapter outline}

% Comparative experiment

% Agglomeration config, algorithm inputs ?

% leverage containerization to resource usage optimization -> 0.5cpu -> do porowniania wynikow schedulingu z optymalnym wykorzystaniem

This chapter describes in detail the experimental environment, its configuration, and setup process -- including the input for the algorithms run by the static scheduler.
The metrics used for evaluation are also introduced along with the reasons for their exploitation.
